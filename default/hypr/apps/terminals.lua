-- Define terminal tag so themes and bindings can single terminals out. ArchBrigade
-- launches TUIs and its own terminal windows under dedicated app-ids
-- (org.archbrigade.btop, org.archbrigade.terminal, TUI.float, ...), so match those too.
-- The class is matched in full, so foot's other app-id needs spelling out.
